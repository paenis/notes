`val f : 'a list -> 'a list
i) type error: `This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type 'a list`
ii) `["d"; "c"; "b"; "a"]`

```ocaml
let rec remove_n n l =
	match l with
	| [] -> []
	| x :: xs -> if n = 0 then xs else x :: remove_n (n - 1) xs
```

3.
```ocaml
let rec last = function
	| [] -> None
	| [ x ] -> Some x
	| _ :: xs -> last xs
```
no builtin, other than reversing and taking the head

```ocaml
let min_edge graph =
	let rec aux min_edge = function
		| [] -> min_edge
		| (x, y, w) :: rest ->
			let _, _, min_w = min_edge in
			if w < min_w then aux (x, y, w) rest else aux min_edge rest
	in
	match graph with
	| [] -> None
	| h :: t -> Some (aux h t)

```ocaml

	List.fold_left

			let _, _, min_w = min in
			if w < min_w then x, y, w else min)
