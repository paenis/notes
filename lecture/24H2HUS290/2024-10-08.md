motorcycle diaries

road movie: necessary to have an odd (do not agree on everything) couple


alberto and ernesto know more about the history of distant civilizations (greeks, etc.) than their own
"the incas knew astronomy, brain surgery... but the spanish had gunpowder"
"we are one single mestizo race", "United America"

spontaneous scenes: chilean market, don nestor
- adds authenticity(?)

river/swimming scene is fictitious
