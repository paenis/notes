bag review pt.2
for exam: order of complexity :D

linked lists
- singly-linked list - sequence of data arranged sequentially(?)
```java
class SinglyLinkedList{
	class Node {
		int data;
		Node next; // null = end of list
		/* snip */
	}
	Node head;
	/* snip */
}

```
- the head is a reference to the first node
	- some lists also have a tail that references last node
- cursor is a link pointing to a specific node
- may be empty (head=tail=null)
