**lec6.2 and after**

- not much on hashing
- implementation questions (i.e. incomplete program), mostly conceptual
	- maybe?? fully implement sorts kms - probably worth looking into
	- 2-3-4 and red-black trees
	- AVL trees
	- just do all the trees stuff again
	- priority queues
- counting sort
- activation records
- catalan number (lol)
- question distribution:
	- 5q 2pts = 10
	- 10q 4pts = 40
	- 5q 10pts = 50
