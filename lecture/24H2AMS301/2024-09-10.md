walk/trail/path
- trail -> walk with distinct edges
- path -> trail with distinct vertices
- cycle: closed trail/walk

euler cycle: passes through each edge exactly once
- all vertices have even degree
euler trail: non-cycle that passes through each edge exactly once
- must have exactly two vertices of odd degree - these are the start and end

hamiltonian cycle: passes through each vertex exactly once
- if a vertex has degree 2, both incident edges must be part of the circuit
- once a vertex has 2 required edges, other incident edges can be ignored
- no subcircuit not containing all edges can be formed
hamiltonian path: open hamiltonian cycle/circuit

a graph with $n$ vertices has a hamilton circuit if all vertices are at least degree $\frac{n}{2}$ for $n\ge 2$

$deg(x_i)\le deg(x_{i+1})$
$\forall k\in\left[0,\frac{n}{2}\right], deg(x_k)>k\text{ or }deg(x_{n-k})\ge n-k\ (k\in\mathbb{Z})$
