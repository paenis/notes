addition principle: if a group of sets are disjoint, the number of ways to select an object from one of the sets is the sum of each of their elements

multiplication principle: if a procedure can be broken into ordered stages, each stage is independent of all previous stages, and all outcomes are distinct, the number of outcomes is the product of the choices in each stage

example One: 
- 40+40=80 $\blacksquare$

example Three:
- two differently-colored d6 are rolled
	- 6 outcomes for each die; outcomes are independent
- $6\cdot 6=36\,\blacksquare$
- what is the prob. there are no doubles?
	- 6x5=30 (5 desired outcomes for second die)
	- 30/36=5/6 (desired/total)

example Four:
- help me!
- different ways to pick an unordered pair of books in different languages
- three disjoint pairs; sf, ft, st
	- 5x6 + 5x8 + 6x8 = 118

example Six:
- nonempty collections of identical sets of elements
- represent collections by number of each element: $(a,g)$
- 6 possible number of apples * 9 possible number of grapefruits = 54
- subtract 1 for empty collection (0,0) = 53
