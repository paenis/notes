index on 10k unitigs

sample uniform random subset of 10^n sequences (?) from gencode human transcriptome
-> save to file

query generator... seeded random

correctness: check that list of experiments returned by query is a subset of Logan
- for every file returned, does it contain the required % of matched kmers?
perf: do other stuff

need better plotting methodology!!!
