data structure - collection of data organized so that items can be stored and retrieved by some fixed techniques i.e. an array can be accessed by index
algorithm - procedure or sequence of instructions for solving a problem, in English, code, or pseudo-code

big O cont.
- $n!>2^n>n^2>n\log{n}>n>\sqrt{n}>\log{n}>1$

abstract data types
- information hiding - separating specification from implementation
- UML class diagram (lol) -> specification
- ADT: mathematical specification of a data structure
	- type of data stored
	- operations on that data
	- parameters of the operations
	- _what_ but not _how_
- example (see slides) (see slides) (see slides)

ungraded hw: implement example
- shallow vs. deep copy
- object class
- inheritance
- interfaces
- abstract class
- object typecasting
- clone
- this & super
