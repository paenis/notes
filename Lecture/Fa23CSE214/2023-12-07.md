review tomorrow on zoom

## Binary Search
precondition: if size > 0, the data structure must have `size` elements starting from `first`; these elements must also be sorted
postcondition: if target appears, return position; otherwise return `-1`
```java
/* implementation varies based on class; generic is just illustrative */
public static <T> int search(T[] a, int first, int size, T target) {
	int mid;
	if (size <= 0) return -1;
	
	mid = first + (size / 2);
	if (target == a[mid]) return mid;
	else if (target < a[mid]) return search(a, first, size / 2, target);
	else return search(a, mid + 1, (size - 1) / 2, target);
}
```

recursively look at the middle element and choose left or right half

let $T(N)$ be the total comparisons for a search on $N$ elements

$T(N)=1+T(\frac{N}{2})$
$T(\frac{N}{2})=1+T(\frac{N}{4})$
... etc.
$T(N)\equiv O(n\log n)$

## Hashing
- data records are stored in a hash table
- position of a record is determined by its key (i.e. id number)
- a hash function maps keys to positions in the table

goals of hashing:
- insert without collision takes $O(1)$ time
- search is also $O(1)$ if the record is in the proper location
- example hash functions:
	- if the key `k` is an integer, `k % tablesize`
	- if `k` is a String (or Object), `k.hashCode() % tablesize`
	- any function that maps `k` to a table position
- table size should be a prime number (?) to avoid collisions

collision resolution (chained hashing and open addressing)
- linear probing: if a position is already taken, look at next position(s) (can wrap around) in order and insert at first empty; same for search
- quadratic probing: look at +1, +4, +9, etc.

considerations for removing keys
- add another array indicating whether a position has been used or not
- if a key is removed, bool is left as true so that we can search past it

load factor
- load factor $\alpha$ of a hash table is given by the formula $$\alpha=\frac{\text{num. elements}}{\text{table size}}$$
- $0\le\alpha\le1$ for linear probing
	- can be greater than 1 for other resolution methods e.g. chained hashing
- as $\alpha$ approaches 1, collisions increase

chained hashing
- array of linked lists
- collisions are inserted at the end of the list
