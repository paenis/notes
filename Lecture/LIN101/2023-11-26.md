2. \[aj] is monopthongized when it (does not occur before a voiceless stop/fricative)/(occurs before a voiced consonant or end of word)
3. The majority of respondents pronounce cot/caught and marry/merry the same. This is expected, as these mergers are common in most varieties of North American English, especially among young people in the case of cot/caught. All respondents pronounce fail and fell differently; this is also expected as this merger is only expressed in some Southern American dialects. All but one respondent each pronounce gem/jim and pool/pull differently; these can be attributed to specific dialectical differences.
