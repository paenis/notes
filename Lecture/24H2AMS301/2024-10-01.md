3 definitions of tree:
- connected graph with no circuit (necessary)
- connected graph with unique path between each pair
- connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges

n^n-2 different undir. trees on n indexed vertices

spanning tree: subgraph that is a tree containing all vertices
two methods:
- dfs (backtrack)
- bfs
if a graph is not connected, no spanning tree

adjacency matrixcel

network - weighted graph

minimum spanning tree :)
- kruskal
	- pick shortest edge
	- pick remaining shortest edges (without forming a circuit)
