walk/trail/path
- trail -> walk with distinct edges
- path -> trail with distinct vertices
- cycle: closed trail/walk

euler cycle: passes through each edge exactly once
- all vertices have even degree
hamiltonian cycle: passes through each vertex exactly once

euler trail: non-cycle that passes through each edge exactly once
- must have exactly two vertices of odd degree - these are the start and end
