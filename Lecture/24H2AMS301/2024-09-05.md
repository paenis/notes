$K_{3,3}$ or $K_5$ subgraph (or configuration thereof) means that a graph is not planar

configuration can be derived by splitting any edge with a vertex or bifurcating vertices

euler formula for connected planar (simple) graphs
$r=e-v+2$ 
regions = edge - vert + 2

corollaries:
$e\le 3v-6$ for $e>1$ -> can use to prove $K_5$ is non-planar
for bipartite planar graphs, $e\le 2v-4$

every connected planar graph must have at least one vertex with degree $\le 5$
$d_{total}\ge 6v$
$\rightarrow2e=d_{total}\ge 6v\ \text{or}\ e\ge 3v$
