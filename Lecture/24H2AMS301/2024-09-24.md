tees (r)

- connected graph with no circuit
- unique path between any two vertices
- blehhhhhhhhhhh
- $n$ vertices and $n-1$ edges

rooted tree: directed graph with all edges directed away from the root (root = the vertex with in-degree 0)

balanced tree: leaves are at max height or one level above

for an $m$-ary tree with $n$ vertices and $i$ internal vertices, $n=mi+1$
- $l=n-i$ ($l$ = leaves)
