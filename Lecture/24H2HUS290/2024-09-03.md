salon mexico in-class notes

plot: woman becomes a cabaret dancer to pay for sister's school

in terms of budget, most work probably went into camera/costumes - no special or practical effects, but they aren't really needed in this type of film

localization is a little funny, subs keep saying *dough* but maybe they're using slang
also makes some corrections to words
"i'll keep the coins" referring to bills

paco (pimp) seems unforgiving and uses threats to get his way

cool use of long shots; showing onlookers to the main cast

lighting in bedroom scene: flashing light -> dark, creates suspense, sense of urgency?
audience can only see in ~1 second intervals

more long shots for walking/running; low angle + panning, usually on stairs (recurring)
they do have dolly shots but don't use them

protag changes into nicer clothes (ironed) to see sister next day
fake story/job to appear presentable to others - actually very poor, struggling for money
principal reprimands her for being distant

the cops found her :( but not really
nvm he's marxistcore - "society is backwards"; he supports her stealing the wallet

paco knows about the wallet & beats her, but lupe (cop) saves her
they fighting!!!

lupe is kinda down bad but mercedes deserves the praise
bro just asked to marry her

movie makes a couple of references to **class struggles, self-sacrifice, heroism**

building up to something bad happening (~1hr)

match -> torch cut

mercedes misses her meeting with pilot/sister because paco got her in prison

---

melodramatic, family plot
movie depicts the real (famous) nightclub

women's films "weepies"

canclini:
- population grew from 185k to 3m 19th to 20th century
- number living in cities grew 10%->70%
- centro historico
	- <5km travel from rest of city
	- Mercedes changes her identity to go there, but the distance is very short

salon mexico was a microcosm of mexico city at the time
- instructed class structure
- see aaron copland
- closed 1991?

muralism!
- promote nationalism

golden age of mexican cinema 30s-50s
