Discrete Mathematics: Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning. Susanna S. Epp. Brief Edition.

- attendance not mandatory
- exams 75%
- homework scanned as pdf, last upload graded

why logic?
- logic models reasoning
- removing ambiguity - english is ambiguous
- mathematical truth is the most rigorous form of truth

this course covers propositional and predicate logic (order 0 & 1)

$x+y=5\rightarrow\text{Not a proposition}$
... for some real numbers $x$ and $y$ -> true
... for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ -> false

propositional variables can be either true (T) or false (F)

basic operators:
- negation $\lnot p$ (~) "not p"
- conjunction $p\land q$ "p and q"
- disjunction $p\lor q$ "p or q"
- conditional $p\implies q$ "p implies q; if p then q; p only if q; q if p; q provided that p"
- biconditional $p\iff q$ "p if and only if q"
- logical equivalence $p\equiv q$ "p logically equivalent to q"

truth tables yay

xor $p\oplus q \equiv (p\lor q)\land\lnot(p\land q)$ - p or q, but not both

- statement or prop. form is a compound statement with prop. variables (p,q,r) and logical connectives
- these should be solved by writing a truth table starting from the innermost parenthesized expressions and working outwards
- a truth table with $n$ variables will have $2^n$ rows

(p or q) and not (not p and r)
-> p or q; p and r; not p; not p and r; not (not p and r); (p or q) and not (not p and r)
