hw is also shared

focus is on the ideas that go behind a language
- lambda calculus & turing machine
- concept of programming paradigms

types & concurrency :D

- a programming paradigm is a sort of "philosophy" that a language takes
	- i.e. OO, functional
- languages may belong to multiple paradigms

breakdown:
- imperative (writing what should be done)
	- procedural: COBOL, FORTRAN, C
	- object-oriented: Java, etc
- declarative (writing what is known to be true, mostly)
	- functional: Haskell, OCaml
	- others

imperative programming depends on statements

```c
assert(x == 7);

x = 2 + 3;
2 + 3; // no-op, but valid

puts("hello world");
goto label;
return 0;

x = sqrt(2);
```
