heaps and trees

todo: backwatch lectures (it's over)

removing from a heap
- return root
- replace root with last node
- remove last node
- rebalance (max heap - root must be greater than children)
	- swap with larger child, going down the heap

```java
public int remove() {
	int answer;
	if (isEmpty()) throw new Exception();
	answer = data[0];
	data[0] = data[heapSize - 1]; // replace root
	heapSize--; // remove last
	fixheap(); // rebalance
	return answer;
}

private void fixheap() {
	int position = 0; int childPos;
	while (position * 2 + 1 < heapSize) { // left child exists
		childPos = position * 2 + 1;
		if (childPos < heapSize - 1 && data[childPos + 1] > data[childPos]) {
			childPos++; // larger of 2 children
		}
		if (data[position] >= data[childPos]) return; // larger than children
		swap(position, childPos);
		position = childPos;
	}
}
```

efficiency of heaps
- assume heap has $N$ nodes -> approx $\log_2N$ leves
- insert: swaps at most once per level so $O(\log_2N)$
- remove: swaps at most once per level so $O(\log_2N)$

priority queues
- can only remove the "maximum" element
- array impl (unsorted): enqueue O(1), dequeue O(n)
- array impl (sorted): enqueue O(n), dequeue O(1)
- heap impl: O(log n)

balanced trees
- for every node, and its subtrees, depths differ by no more than 1

[B-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)
- balanced multi-way search tree
- designed to work well with direct-access secondary storage by minimizing I/O ops
- a node can hold more than one item

B-tree rules
- the root may have as few as one element; every other node has `MINIMUM` elements
- `MINIMUM` is half of node capacity
- elements are stored in a partially filled array, sorted ascending
- number of children is always one more than number of elements for non-leaf nodes
- for any non-leaf node, an element at index `i` is:
	- greater than all elements in subtree `i`
	- less than all elements in subtree `i + 1`
- every leaf has the same depth

insertion rebalances bottom-up - see slides

searching in B-trees
- current node:
	- let `k` = number of data values in this node
	- let `i` = the first index such that `data[i] >= item`. if every data value is less than `item`, set `i = k`
	- if `item = data[i]`, return true (assume `i < k`)
		- else if node has no children, return false
		- else call search on `subtree[i]`
