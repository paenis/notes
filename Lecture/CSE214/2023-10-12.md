## Stacks pt.2

evaluating expressions
- an expression is fully parenthesized if every operator has a pair of balanced parentheses marking its left and right operands
	- `((3 * (5 + 7)) - 9)`
	- precedence gaming
- first op is in the innermost set of parentheses; immediately before the first right parenthesis
- replace sub-expression with its result and search for next right parenthesis
- -> use two stacks to keep track of expressions
	- upon hitting right paren, pop 2 from operands and pop 1 from operators
- Ok

infix, prefix (Polish), postfix (reverse Polish)
(5 + 7) * 9 $\equiv$ * + 5 7 9 in prefix
(5 + 7) * 9 $\equiv$ 5 7 + 9 * in postfix

precedence:
1. parenthesized
2. \*/ before +-
3. all other cases ltr

A + B * (C * D - E / F) / G - H
C D * E F / - B * G / A + H - (postfix :D) does not preserve operand order
A B C D * E F / - * G / + H - alternative postfix preserving order
\- \+ A / \* B \- \* C D / E F G H (prefix D:)

shitty shunting yard (fully parenthesized only)
- operands -> output
- operators -> stack
- upon rparen, pop 1 operator -> output
